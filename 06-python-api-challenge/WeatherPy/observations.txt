1) Data shows us that temps are in fact hotter as one approaches the equator.

2) Colder temperatures are experienced sooner when moving south of the equator than if one moves north-- i.e. Temp of 50 degrees is experienced between -40 and -50 lat in the southern hemisphere, but between 60 and 70 lat in the northern hemisphere.

3) Wind speeds tend to stay below 20mph across all latitudes.
